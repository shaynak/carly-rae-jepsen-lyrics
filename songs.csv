22,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (Whoa, oh)
22 (Dancing like)
22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"
All Too Well,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
Begin Again,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Come Back... Be Here,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus 2]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here"
Everything Has Changed,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"
Girl at Home,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her"
Holy Ground,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"
I Almost Do,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you're touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me"
I Knew You Were Trouble.,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
So, shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Red,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met

Yeah, yeah, red

Sad Beautiful Tragic,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, ""Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

State of Grace,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (Never) saw you coming
And I'll never (Never) be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (Never) saw you coming

And I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
Stay Stay Stay,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(Ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)"
The Last Time,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Outro: Taylor Swift, Gary Lightbody, Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this"
The Lucky One,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh"
The Moment I Knew,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""
And that was the moment I knew"
Treacherous,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus 1]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away

Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night

That nothing safe is worth the drive

Follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,Red (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

Afterglow,Lover,"[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow"
Cornelia Street,Lover,"[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car"
Cruel Summer,Lover,"[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Daylight,Lover,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love"
Death by a Thousand Cuts,Lover,"[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know"""
False God,Lover,"[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love"
I Forgot That You Existed,Lover,"[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah"
I Think He Knows,Lover,"[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
""So where we gonna go?""
I whisper in the dark
""Where we gonna go?""
I think he knows

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)

It’s Nice to Have a Friend,Lover,"[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
""Wanna hang out?"" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow

Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

London Boy,Lover,"[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you

Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah"
Lover,Lover,"[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

ME!,Lover,"[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer

Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,Lover,"[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl""
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)

Paper Rings,Lover,"[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this

Soon You’ll Get Better,Lover,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because

The Archer,Lover,"[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

The Man,Lover,"[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man"
You Need To Calm Down,Lover,"[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"
All Night Diner,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Bridge]
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Outro]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now"
Am I Ready for Love,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love"
Barnyard Song,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

[Chorus]
You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

[Verse 2]
Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

[Chorus]
So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on"
Being with My Baby,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby"
Better Off,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 2]
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 3]
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better"
Brought Up That Way,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says ""Baby girl, what's wrong with you?""
She says ""Please don't make me go back there again""
She said ""I wish there was some way to make them stop it""
So he drives down to that principal's office and says

[Chorus]
""I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way""

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said ""He tried but there's just some things I won't do""
And through the tears she said ""I couldn't do that to you""
And he said

[Chorus]
""I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way""

[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night, says ""It's Officer Tate""
He said ""Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast""
He says ""God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way""

[Outro]
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes"
By The Way,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand
I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

[Chorus]
And by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

[Verse 2]
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
I'm looking good

[Chorus]
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

[Outro]
By the way, you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wondered
Still got the same old number, just in case
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh"
Can I Go with You,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
Closest To A Cowboy,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

[Verse 2]
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

[Bridge]
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I'll never look
At a sunset the same night

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me"
Cross My Heart,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I've been counting days and
I've been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreaming of you baby
I've been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
'Cause I've been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Bridge]
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you've seen one
I'd like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

[Chorus x2]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight"
Didn’t They,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

[Verse 2]
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh

[Verse 3]
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

[Chorus]
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh

[Outro]
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day"
Don’t Hate Me For Loving You,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 2]
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 3]
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

[Chorus]
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

[Outro]
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye"
Down Came The Rain,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Verse 2]
In through the window I see her with you
I'm soaked to the skin, you're warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Bridge]
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain"
Fall Back On You,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Verse 2]
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you"
Firefly,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 2]
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Bridge]
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly"
Gracie,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 2]
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do"
Her*,Unreleased Songs,"[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her"
I’d Lie,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

[Chorus]
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Verse 2]
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

[Chorus]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Verse 3]
He stands there, then walks away
My god, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything
But my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

[Chorus]
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I'd lie"
I Know What I Want,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 2]
Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want

Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

What I wanted

Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want

I Need You Now,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

[Verse 2]
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
That I've come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you

Who's gonna hold you

Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you cause I don't need you now
I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
""I need you I need you""
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now"
I Wished On A Plane,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Bridge]
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

[Chorus]
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim"
Just South of Knowing Why,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 3]
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

[Chorus]
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

[Verse 4]
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why"

The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down

There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you

And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

[Chorus 2]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I try to not break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war

Long Time Coming,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

[Verse 2]
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

It will be a long time, long time going, going

Love They Haven’t Thought of Yet,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

[Verse 2]
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

Love To Lose,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

All the sleepless nights or the endless fights

Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name

Me and Britney,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

[Verse 2]
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn't been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

[Bridge]
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I'm sorry for waking you up but I didn't know who else to call
Or where else to go

[Verse 3]
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
We're not as young, but we're still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we're old, we're still going to be

Between now and forever

And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view

One Thing,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me

And back to the conversation

I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

One Way Ticket,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything"
Our Last Night,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

[Chorus]
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

[Verse 2]
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

[Chorus]
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night

It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know

Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin"
Sunshine,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse One]
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything

[Verse Two]
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything

[Bridge]
I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine

Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine"
Ten Dollars And A Six Pack,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so""
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said, ""let them say we're crazy,"" you said, ""let's go fishing tonight""
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so""
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

[Chorus]
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's ""I told you so""
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack"
Tennessee,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Bridge]
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee"
That’s When,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I said I know
He said need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees, just like that
He said, ""When can I come back?""

[Chorus]
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this

The Diary of Me,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring, kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what's the word on you?
Lay low
I'm a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside

Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

Thinkin’ ’Bout You,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

[Chorus]
And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always ending' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be

Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me

It should be
It could be

Thirteen Blocks (Can’t Call It Love),Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don't offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

[Verse 2]
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they're half as stubborn as me
They'll just keep on shining bright
I ain't ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain't strong
I'll just move on
And leave this in my past


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll act today
Until you find somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it


[Verse 3]
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don't know
Oh and it troubles me so


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll feel today
I see you found somebody new
And I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile"
This Is Really Happening,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

Tell me
You'll never leave me

Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun, no I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & T-Pain & Both]
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy

Til Brad Pitt Comes Along,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said ""my point exactly""
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Bridge]
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along"

Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you

If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you

But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep, soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

Writing Songs About You,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you

Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby

You All Over Me,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
You leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be
Like the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Verse 2]
Guess the worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""don't you wish you had me"" grin
I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then

[Chorus]
Well I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Bridge]
I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me
I still got you all over me

Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car

In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said

Your Anything,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer

Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door

If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you

The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?

Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was

Bad Blood,1989,"[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood

Blank Space,1989,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

Clean,1989,"[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found

I Wish You Would,1989,"[Verse 1]
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus 1]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide

Out of the Woods,1989,"[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
(Out of the woods)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)

This Love,1989,"[Verse 1]

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh"
Welcome to New York,1989,"[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York"
Wildest Dreams,1989,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning (Burning) it (It) down (Down)
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (Ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hafhaa)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,"[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Verse]
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Bridge]
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?"
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Outro]
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl"
Invisible,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

[Chorus - Variation]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile"
Mary’s Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, ""Oh my my my""

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh my my my""

[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said ""I do"" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my"
Our Song,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
Should’ve Said No,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home, saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Verse 2]
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away
I should say
Hey, by the way

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?

[Outro]
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na"
Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

The Outside,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Verse 2]
You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Bridge]
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, oh-oh

Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie"""
​august,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(""Meet me behind the mall"")
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)"
​betty,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"
​cardigan,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"
​epiphany,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
""Sir, I think he's bleeding out""
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)

[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen"
​exile,folklore,"[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah"
​hoax,folklore,"[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do"
​illicit affairs,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times"
​invisible string,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)"
​mad woman,folklore,"[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say ""move on,"" but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that"
​mirrorball,folklore,"[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight"
​my tears ricochet,folklore,"[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet"
​peace,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"
​seven,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

[Bridge]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long"
​the 1,folklore,"[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)"
​the last great american dynasty,folklore,"[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time"
​this is me trying,folklore,"[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying"
Back to December,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time"
Better Than Revenge,Speak Now,"[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage"
Dear John,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known

[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known"
Enchanted,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you"
Haunted,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"
Innocent,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back"
Last Kiss,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

[Verse 4]
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last"
Long Live,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"
Mean,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"
Mine,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)"
Never Grow Up,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"
Sparks Fly,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly"
Speak Now,Speak Now,"[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said ""speak now""

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""speak now""

[Chorus - Variation]
And you say
""Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door""
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
""Speak now"""
The Story of Us,Speak Now,"[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End"
Bad Blood/Should’ve Said No,Uncategorized,"[Chorus: Bad Blood]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Bad Blood]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Bad Blood]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood

[Chorus: Should've Said No]
You should've said, ""No"", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge: Bad Blood]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut

Clean/Long Live/New Year’s Day,Uncategorized,"[Verse 1: Clean]

The drought was the very worst
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Clean]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus: Clean]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

I Did Something Bad (Reputation Tour Remix),Uncategorized,"[Intro]
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...

Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

Style / Love Story / You Belong With Me,Uncategorized,"[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 1]

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
Let me hear you please make some noise for my band

[Verse 2]

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go
Give it up for my guitarist LA!

[Chorus]

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

[Bridge]

Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus]

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes""

[Bridge]

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

[Chorus]

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me"

It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2: TIWWCHNT]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady

And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling

Beautiful Ghosts,Cats: Highlights From the Motion Picture Soundtrack,"[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"
Macavity,Cats: Highlights From the Motion Picture Soundtrack,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

[Outro: Idris Elba, Taylor Swift]
When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there"
Breathe,Fearless,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry"
Change,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"
Fearless,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah"
Fifteen,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before.""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath, as you walk through the doors"
Forever & Always,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah"
Hey Stephen,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Outro]
Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself"
Love Story,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go"", and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go"", and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus 3]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
Tell Me Why,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know"
The Best Day,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"
The Way I Loved You,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

[Outro]
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you"
White Horse,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"
You Belong with Me,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"
You’re Not Sorry,Fearless,"[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no...)"
Call It What You Want,reputation,"[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]

Dancing with Our Hands Tied,reputation,"[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I - 

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I - 

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]

Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)"
Delicate,reputation,"[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best

Don’t Blame Me,reputation,"[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Dress,reputation,"[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about - 

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

Only bought this dress so you could take it off"
End Game,reputation,"[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game"
Getaway Car,reputation,"[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car"
Gorgeous,reputation,"[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous"
I Did Something Bad,reputation,"[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one

Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good"
King of My Heart,reputation,"[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me ""Baby"" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)

With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once"
Look What You Made Me Do,reputation,"[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me - 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me - 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me - 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me - )
""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!"" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me - 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me - 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do"
New Year’s Day,reputation,"[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 1]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus 2]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus 2]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

Please don't ever become a stranger

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

...Ready for It?,reputation,"[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low

I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

Oh, are you ready for it?

You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)

So It Goes...,reputation,"[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes…

Come here, dressed in black now

Scratches down your back now

This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,reputation,"[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things"
​champagne problems,evermore,"[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"
​closure,evermore,"[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure

[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure"
​coney island,evermore,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold"

And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

And I'm never gonna love again

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure

​gold rush,evermore,"[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush

I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it

​happiness,evermore,"[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness"
​ivy,evermore,"[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you

[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you"
​l​ong story short,evermore,"[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better

I know better

I know better
But you're still around"
"​no body, no crime",evermore,"[Intro: HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it

No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

​’tis the damn season,evermore,"[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
 'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
 'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
 'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
 'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now

​tolerate it,evermore,"[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you"
​willow,evermore,"[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man

Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Christmases When You Were Mine,The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection - EP,"[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine"
Last Christmas,The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection - EP,"[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special"

And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight"

Cold as You,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you

Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you"

In a field behind your yard

Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn

Sweet Tea and God’s Graces,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Verse 2]
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
""Hey, how have you been?""
You caught me with that old smile
Said, ""It's really been a while
And I still think about back when""

[Chorus]
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Outro]
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah"
Tied Together with a Smile,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Outro]
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby"
Welcome Distraction,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the last thing I needed tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I'm acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction"
We Were Happy,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sort of how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy"
What Do You Say,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you want to go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever

It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there

If you don't own up will yeah

Who I’ve Always Been,2004-2005 Demo CD,"[Verse 1]
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I aren't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 2]
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, ""this is what I do""
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

[Hook]
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl, and who I've always been"

But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

That you'll come in with the rain

Forever & Always (Piano Version),Fearless (Platinum Edition),"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said ""forever and always""

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said ""forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

Jump Then Fall,Fearless (Platinum Edition),"[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today

The Other Side of the Door,Fearless (Platinum Edition),"[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you"

Just let it flow

But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue

You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes

The tricky thing

When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""

If This Was a Movie,Speak Now (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you""
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like

And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out""
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now

Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now"
Ours,Speak Now (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"
Superman,Speak Now (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?""
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus - Variation]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down"
​it’s time to go,evermore (deluxe version),"[Verse 1]
When your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that

[Verse 2]
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Verse 3]
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Verse 4]
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left

[Verse 5]
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Outro]
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
And you know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go"
​r​ight where you left me,evermore (deluxe version),"[Verse 1]
Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

[Chorus]
Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else
She won't know it, she's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

[Bridge]
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight""
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

[Chorus]
I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever"
New Romantics,1989 (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker
You can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (Ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me

The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing, and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle, oh-oh
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle

Wonderland,1989 (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
Flashing lights, and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Ey, ey)

Whoa, in Wonderland

[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (Ey, ey)

You Are in Love,1989 (Deluxe),"[Verse 1]
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

Should’ve Said No (Alternate Version),Beautiful Eyes - EP,"[Verse 1]
It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said ""yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should have known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth this?
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me"
Sweeter Than Fiction,One Chance (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),"[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and (I, I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me

​the lakes,folklore (deluxe version),"[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you"
Today Was a Fairytale,Valentine’s Day (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),"[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet

All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Christmas Tree Farm,,"[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there

Watching the fire glow

Only The Young,,"[Verse 1]
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered this time

[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line (And run, and run, and run)

Ronan,,"[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back"
