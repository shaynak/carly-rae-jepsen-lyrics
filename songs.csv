"10,000 People",Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
Still obsessed with vanity
The young girl I'm meant to be
The surface is no place for me
I've tiptoed around the truth until my anger took a stand and said
Freedom, would you please define, is your dream to seize mine?
Just a pretty girl, with pretty things
What will you do when I was crashing into all the joy and hurt it brings, oh

[Chorus]
Go outside
Look to the sky
Ten billion stars, getting blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
Can you feel it?

[Verse 2]
The taxi home, your giant bed
The books you flipped through, never read
The big wide world you mapped and framed
That song where you know all the words
You never stop, you never heard
That person's reaching out to you
Stop crossing off your list of things to do
There's so much to see through, this life's for you

[Chorus]
Go outside (Go outside)
Look to the sky
Ten billion stars, getting blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
Ooh, and I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
Can you feel it? (I can feel it)

[Bridge]
I'm by myself tonight
But I don't feel alone
I'm by myself tonight (I'm by myself tonight)
I'm feeling right at home

[Chorus]
Go outside (Go outside)
Look to the sky (Look to the sky)
Ten billion stars, getting blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
Ooh, and I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
Can you feel it? (I can feel it)

[Outro]
Your money reaches past the mark
[?] just spoke of all those Romeos you thought you want
Wanting everything could leave you standing in the mirror
Something must be wrong with me, why do I chase away all my company?
I never knew love would be what you've shown me
(Romeo)
You've shown me"

Bullseye,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I watched my heart trapezing to the water
I clapped my hands as you were taking a bow
I sat and watched you leaving for an hour
I still can't believe it now, oh

[Chorus 1]
We could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I thought it would be you and I
We could have had a life supply
We could have hit the bullseye
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We could have hit the bullseye

[Verse 2]
I saw my brother standing at the altar
I thought at you as they were taking their vows
I sat and watched this picture for an hour
I still believe somehow, oh

[Chorus 1]
We could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I thought it would be you and I

I could give you what you wanted
You never told me what you needed
I could give you what you wanted
Tell me what you need, tell me what you need

[Chorus 2]
Cause it could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Could have hit the bullseye
And I wish I was the other guy
I wish I was the one to make you cry
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Or could have hit the bullseye
And we could have had a life supply
We could have hit the bullseye
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, don't you know?
Could have hit the bullseye
And, and, could have hit the bullseye"

You push your fingers up into my hair
Love hangover through the morning light

Keeps me on my toes
Yeah, it keeps me on my toes
Wonder if he knows how deep the arrow goes
Well, that's for me to know, that's for me to know
That's for me to know
That's for me to know and you to wonder"
White Lie,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
All I do is miss you
Seconds feel like hours (Oh)
Everybody knows it
Never like I chose it
Nothing in my power
I'm not insecure, love
I just think you're perfect (Oh)
Limits to your love, though
How to make your heart know
That I could be worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
So simple when your mind's made up
This could be a one night dream
Touching on my skin, wanna let you in
This could be the best for me
So simple when your guard comes up
Like we don't need nobody else
You're pulling up my skirt, buttons on my shirt
I don't like to undress myself

[Chorus]
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything
For you I'd stay up all night
All the nights, I never wanted anything
For you just break my heart, boy
All the time, you never wanted anything
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything

[Verse 2]
All I do is smile straight
Through my disappointment (Oh)
Way before you wake up
I'd reach for my make-up
But I know it's pointless

[Pre-Chorus]
So simple when your mind's made up
This could be an one night dream
Touching on my skin, wanna let you in
This could be the best for me
So simple when your guard comes up
Like we don't need nobody else
You're pulling up my skirt, buttons on my shirt
I don't like to undress myself

[Chorus]
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything
For you I'd stay up all night
All the nights, I never wanted anything
For you just break my heart, boy
All the time, you never wanted anything
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything

[Bridge]
So bad, so bad
I never wanted anything
So bad, so bad
I never wanted anything

[Chorus]
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything
For you I'd stay up all night
All the nights, I never wanted anything
For you just break my heart, boy
All the time, you never wanted anything
For you I'd say this one white
Little lie, I never wanted anything"
Wildflowers,Unreleased Songs,"[Verse 1]
I wore your shirt as I was running away from you
'Cause I like to keep the good things
I know you're hurt and I'd like to sit right next to you
But you'd only say the worst things

And every city was our city
Like every road was our own
And you loved me like you knew you'd miss me
It's like every prophecy you told, oh

Wildflowers you brought me
Are crumbled in my hands
I killed them, you caught me
The stain is on my hands

I took a trip to the furthest place that I could find
'Cause I like to do the wrong things
I walked a street that I had never walked down once before
'Cause I like to try the new things

Like every road was our own

Wildflowers you brought me

Moon, where's the man in you
Show the way to us
The sky is turning black now
Moon, what you trying to do
It's too late for us and there's no turning back now

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even though my love is true
I know that we can't be together

[Chorus]
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

[Chorus]
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again"

Warm Blood,E•MO•TION,"[Verse 1]
I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
And I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

I would throw in the towel for you, boy

Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied

When I Needed You,E•MO•TION,"[Verse 1]
What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
You come to me in dreams at night
(You come to me in dreams at night)
I wake up and I see the light

Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you

'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone?
When I needed someone
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey

I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
My feet up to my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself

Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you

Your Type,E•MO•TION,"[Verse 1]

Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it

Oh, when will you wake up and get it?
This close, we almost said it

You don't make it easy
It's in my body language, read me

Every time you look at me, I say it silently
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
This close, we almost said it

Well, I hear selectively
That still means someday you might be
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah

I often play it
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close, but we couldn't say it

To the feelings that we share, so not fair

I wish somehow
I could say them now, oh

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber]
It's not you, blame it all on me, I was running from myself
Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we, we were gonna be

Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah

What makes you so beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is it too late or too soon?
I'm right outside here wanting you
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

[Chorus]
I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a ""wish I could""
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

[Bridge]
Imagine you, imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me, imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

[Chorus]
I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a ""wish I could""
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?"
I Know You Have a Girlfriend,Kiss,"[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't need to look far
Everywhere I turn there, there you are
Somebody should sound the alarm
'Cause when you try to get me alone, you
Talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime

[Chorus 1]
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your te-te-te-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, won't you let me be?
I'm begging you, stop begging me

[Verse 2]
Tiptoeing around all the facts
Tease me 'til I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
'Cause you've been trying to get me alone
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes

[Chorus 1]
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak

I know you have a girlfriend

I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, won't you let me be?
I'm begging you, stop begging me

I know you have a girlfriend
And it cuts me like a knife
I know you have a girlfriend
Is she gonna be your wife?
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your te-te-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
Tell me, where is she tonight?
I know you have a girlfriend
Cause I heard you had a fight
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, won't you let me be?
I'm begging you, stop begging me

Melt with You,Kiss,"[Chorus]
If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about it
I know something's wrong
Fading out in the distance
We've been lost in the songs
Let's turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge

Hearing echoes and voices
All I couldn't see
We have all kinds of choices
If it was uṗ to me
I'd turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

[Chorus]
If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

[Bridge]
And every time that passes by, I see you
I see you
Ever now and then, I like to pretend

[Breakdown]
If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside
I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you"
More Than a Memory,Kiss,"[Verse 1]
Speak to me (To me)
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe (To breathe)

Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling, with your sneaky eyes
Now what could you be looking at me for?

I give into this fight

I never thought about you
You never thought about us
Yeah, it came out of the blue
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need for your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every morning with you
I wake up just dreaming

Never guess what came after

You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

Hold me back, baby boy, oh, hold me close
Love's so real, I can't go slow
Can't imagine, right away, I feel it so

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

Hmm, hmm

Everything He Needs,Dedicated,"[Verse 1]
He's strong, not one to settle down
You know he's that guy
Electric, those lips can wear me out
Wild thing he's all mine

It's crazy, but when he can't sleep, I understand
Like pressure points, my love can ease him in my hand

Sweat disco all night

Pull right, a burnt-out streetlight, only halfway home

Feels Right,Dedicated,"[Verse 1: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right when it feels right

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Asa Taccone]
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I'd do, boy, anything to step with you

[Verse 2: Carly Rae Jepsen]
True fact
Baby, I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right (Maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
And I do, boy, anything to step with you

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right when it feels right
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life with no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right

'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you

All my feelings for you all night, all night
Don't stare, don't stare

Julien,Dedicated,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin', it feels like every day
I got the blues, babe, not going away
Another bad dream where you were running away

Asked me to leave with you, but I could never decide
I've been so torn up, I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love

Both Sides Now,Curiosity - EP,"[Verse 1]

And ice cream castles in the air

From up and down and still somehow

The dizzy, dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real

You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads
They say I've changed
Well something's lost and something's gained in living every day

What an amateur
To be like this, exposed
You deny the other side of me
That strips good love away
And you kissed my mirror reflection
When I looked at me today

[Chorus]
When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

[Verse 2]
Worlds collide
I see a side of you
I never saw before
We can work it out, let's talk it out
I want to know you more
Just decided that I'd like to side with you
Oh, every time
And if you ask me how I'm feeling now
You know I'm feeling fine

[Chorus]
When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

[Bridge]
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me, look at me the way you do

[Chorus]
When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

[Bridge]
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me, look at me the way you do
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do

Hotel Shampoos,Tug of War,"[Verse 1]

I'll be runnin' out soon
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more
Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought this summer you'd be gone away again
Ooh, he's gone away again

[Chorus]
We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

[Verse 2]
Craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes

Driving in a sweet brand new car
I'm living the life of a superstar
I got my way again, hmm, I got my way again

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

In all our pretty disguises
In all out pretty disguises
Work hard, oh, we work until we're sleepin'

Oh, we sleep, but we're not dreaming
Where's his love
Where's his kisses
He says ""sorry babe, this has got away from me""
He's gone away from me

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right...

Money and the Ego,Tug of War,"[Verse 1]
Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me
Make your arms a willow tree
And you can bend with me
Any where that I am going

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me why?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

Keep your eyes on me
And I'll look to you so I can see
What I am here for
Pull the wool over my eyes
Please kiss this day goodbye
Only you can get me going

Giving up is all you've got

But don't be afraid to sit down in your shower
Stay in there for hours

[Verse 3]
Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for

Money, and the money, and the egos

Sour Candy,Tug of War,"[Verse 1: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Sour candy endings
Coffee stained but aware
Oh, I'm so tangled up in my big sunglasses
And bed hungry, second-day fare

[Chorus: Both]
No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

And I've been very cautious
Trying numbness instead of pain
All your humor makes me, makes me nauseous
What a twisted, twisted, twisted game

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

Oh, get yourself home
You leave him alone
On second thought, I regret the pink stiletto
Ooh-ooh-ooh

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder

So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad we went under"

Worldly Matters,Tug of War,"[Verse 1]
Hot pink skies
Twilight of the day
I think that I've been going 'bout this the wrong way
Kids on my street got it right, man
Barefoot hide and seek
My best friend, she lives up the road
Haven't talked to her in weeks

Oh, time don't blind me
I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns and the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all, no, not at all

[Verse 2]
I keep on walking, I stop
Ditching all my plans
I want to climb that cedar tree
And leave me in good hands
What happened to me?
On the way to something higher
What will be left?
When I have all that I desire?

[Chorus]
Oh, time don't blind me
I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns and the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all, no, not at all
No, not at all"

You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
It's a tragedy, boy
Every time you ask me

He was born in Vegas among the stars
And on his cheek, beauty mark
Barely noticed it from the start
A constellation to stir my heart

My home is your body, how can I stay away?

Your night after night
Come closer, I'll hold you

What it feels like when I'm next to you
It's a soft touch that I read into

Now I Don’t Hate California After All,Dedicated Side B,"[Verse 1]
My lover don't mind if
I follow him 'round
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time

To be alone on a cold night

But it's all gonna turn around
And I swear it'll be alright (Alright, ah, ah, ah)

A thousand stories before

But get yourself off the floor

Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what you're not in love?
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

When they all got the perfect guy
Hold on for the long ride (Long ride, ah, ah, ah)

To Be Without You,Dear You - EP,"[Verse 1]
If you never see my face

A lot for you
I can see that you don't care
And I'm scared to fall without you
It's so hard to fall

A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
And I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

For that second you might turn to see me
Can you see me
Really see me
Now I see it's all a lie
That I've lived inside my own illusion
All this meaning
Means nothing

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

Oh, and
I am so lost
Lost, lost

So I get myself upright
Try to dream of anything but you tonight
'Cause waking up
Is a losing fight
Yeah, the dream just doesn't last
And I wake to realize the truth too fast
And I'm wishing
For my past

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

Runaways,Ballerina (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),"[Verse 1]
I was at our old school sitting in the sun
Waiting for the passing trains
Wishing you were here
Wishing we could run
Wishing we could run away

Right across the river in a town so small
The leaves are gonna change us when they start to fall
Take us to the city, where we'll have it all
We'll have it all

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I would run away with you now
We could do the things we promised we would always do
Take a train to Timbuktu, we could join the circus
Oh yeah, would you just escape with me now?
We could do the things we promised, dreaming wide awake
Take me back to yesterday
We could be the runaways

Remember how that one time things were getting hard
I met you in your old backyard
We packed a couple bags and we stole your father's car
But we only ever got so far

The leaves are gonna change you when they start to fall
If we make it to the city, then we'll have it all
We'll have it all
